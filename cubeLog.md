# Cubing Log

## Log Date: ___________
1. What did I try to learn?
-How to do three different algorithms on a 2 by 2 rubiks cube
-How to know what state my cube is in before solving the second layer
-How to look around a cube, to solve that last layer

2. How did I try to learn it?
-I went on the given source "you can do the cube"
-I watched a video at home to understand it better
-I asked my teacher for some help

3. What were the end results?
-I can solve a rubiks cube in 33 seconds
-I now feel happy to say that I can solve it
-I now look at a rubiks cube differently (knowing that there's math behind it)
